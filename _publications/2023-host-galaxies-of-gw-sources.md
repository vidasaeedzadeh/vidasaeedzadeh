The formation of supermassive black holes in the Universe and its role in the properties of the galaxies is one of the open questions in the field of astrophysics and cosmology. Though the direct measurement of the supermassive black holes in the Universe is traditionally made with the help of electromagnetic waves which have already played a pivotal role in understanding galaxy formation, gravitational waves bring an independent avenue to detect numerous supermassive binary black holes in the observable Universe in the nano-Hertz range using the pulsar timing array observation. This can bring a new way to understand the connection between the formation of binary supermassive black holes and galaxy formation if we can connect theoretical models with multi-messenger observations namely GW data and galaxy surveys. Along these lines of multi-messenger exploration of galaxy formation, we present here a first paper on this series based on numerical simulation {\sc Romulus} on the expected properties (such as star formation rate, stellar mass, halo mass, gas density, galaxy morphology, and color)  of the host galaxies of SMBHs and propose on how this can be used to connect with observations of nano-Hertz gravitational wave signal and galaxy surveys. We show that the most dominant contribution to the background will arise from sources with high chirp masses which are likely to reside in low redshift early-type galaxies with high stellar mass, 
largely old stellar population, and low star formation rate, and that reside at centers of galaxy groups and manifest evidence of recent mergers. The masses of the sources show a correlation with the halo mass and stellar mass of the host galaxies. This theoretical study will help in understanding the host properties of the GW sources and can help in establishing a connection with observations.
