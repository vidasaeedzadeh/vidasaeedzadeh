title: "Massive central galaxies of galaxy groups in the Romulus simulations: an overview of galaxy properties at z = 0"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/massivegalaxiesinRomulus
excerpt: 'Contrary to many stereotypes about massive galaxies, observed brightest group galaxies (BGGs) are diverse in their star formation rates, kinematic properties, and morphologies. Studying how they evolve into and express such diverse characteristics is an important piece of the galaxy formation puzzle. We use a high-resolution cosmological suite of simulations Romulus and compare simulated central galaxies in group-scale haloes at z = 0 to observed BGGs.'
