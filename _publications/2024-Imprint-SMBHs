The formation and evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) remains an open question in the field of modern cosmology. 
The detection of nanohertz (n-Hz) gravitational waves via pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) in the form of individual events and 
the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) offers a promising avenue for studying SMBH evolution across cosmic time, 
with SGWB signal being the immediately detectable signal with the currently accessible telescope sensitivities. By connecting 
the galaxy properties in the large scale (Gpc scale) cosmological simulation such as MICECAT with the small scale (~ Mpc scale) 
galaxy simulations from ROMULUS, we show that different scenarios of galaxy-SMBH evolution with redshift leads to a 
frequency-dependent spatial anisotropy in the SGWB signal. The presence of slow evolution of the SMBHs in the Universe leads to 
a pronounced blue anisotropic spectrum of the SGWB. In contrast, if SMBHs grow faster in the Universe in lighter galaxies, 
the frequency-dependent spatial anisotropy exhibits a more flattened anisotropic spectrum. This additional aspect of the SGWB 
signal on top of the monopole SGWB signal, can give insight on how the SMBHs form in the high redshift Universe and its interplay 
with the galaxy formation from future measurements.
