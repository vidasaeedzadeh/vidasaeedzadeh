title: "Cool and gusty, with a chance of rain: Dynamics of multiphase CGM around massive galaxies in the Romulus simulations"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/MultiphaseCGMinRomulus
excerpt: 'In this paper Using high-resolution {\sc Romulus} simulations, we explore the origin and evolution of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of massive galaxies. We find that CGM is both multiphase and dynamic. In exploring its dynamic we find seven patterns of evolution, two of them are ways that gas cools. Gas cools via (1) filamentary cooling inflows and (2) condensations forming from rapidly cooling density perturbations. We find that perturbations are mainly seeded by orbiting substructures. '
